# AutoMetic Assistant: The Future of Personalized AI

Welcome to the initial stages of the AutoMetic Assistant Project. This ambitious venture aims to build a personalized autonomous multimodal assistant, pushing the boundaries of AI interaction and convenience. Inspired by the advanced PandaGPT framework, our project promises a revolution in digital life management.

## Functionality

The goal for AutoMetic Assistant is to pilot your PC, view your desktop, and complete complex tasks. Through multimodal inputs, it aims to offer an unprecedented level of understanding and interaction, setting it apart from existing AI models.

## Data Collection and Repository

A key aspect of this project is the development of a secure repository for data collection. This system will gather chat data throughout your day, creating a comprehensive understanding of your communication style and preferences, for personalized assistance.

## Training and Personalization

One of the distinctive features planned for AutoMetic Assistant is its ability to be trained on an easy chat format. This format facilitates unique training approaches, allowing the possibility of creating AI clones, and other diverse applications. By exporting your chat data to the model, the assistant will be able to learn, adapt, and mirror your communication style.

## Overnight Learning

The overnight learning feature is another innovative facet of the AutoMetic Assistant. As you sleep, it's intended to perform sentiment analysis on the day's interactions, learning from its performance to enhance its services.

## Continuous Improvement

AutoMetic Assistant is designed to be more than a tool; it's intended to be a learning companion that improves with each interaction. Using iterative learning processes and cutting-edge AI techniques, the assistant aims to refine its understanding of user needs and preferences.
